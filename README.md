# I got tired of bad MMA commentary, so I built a predictive model that did a better job. 

This repository contains code and data used in demonstrating various supervised machine learning algorithms to predict fight outcomes in the largest mixed martial arts organization in the world, the [UFC](www.ufc.com), using the R language.

## Overview 

When I was growing up in the late 90's to early 2000's, everyone I knew had wanted to become a professional athlete in some form.  People like Kobe Bryant (R.I.P.), Brendan Shanahan, or Ronaldo were essentially superstars to all of us and we all had taken turns being them during pick-up games at the local park or on the street (in between the car passing by every 5-10 minutes).  While the idea of being like them was great and all, I kind of knew it wasn't really going to be in the cards being one of the smallest person in my class, can't skate backwards to save my life, and almost zero coordination with my feet with respect to the ball. However, despite being ready to complete close that aspiration, there was an emerging sport that had both captured my attention and gave me a glimmer of hope in pursuing a professional atheletic career.  That was mixed martial arts.  

Mixed martial arts (or MMA) had everything I liked about sports: an array of technical skills and strategies to solve complex problems with dire consequences, a growing and passionate fandom, and be a platform to display a triumph of human will in the truest sense.  Ever since I saw it for the first time, I knew I had to give it a shot.  As I got older, I thought I had a shot after having wrestled in college and taking up some other necessary skills in the form of Muay Thai and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu.  While some of my like-minded wrestling teammates had successfully moved on to a career in MMA, mine's came to a crashing halt upon the realization I didn't take too kindly to getting punched in the face as I orignally thought.  Guess Mike Tyson was right, "*Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the mouth*".  Despite dreams being dashed, I still remain an avid MMA fan and grappling hobbyist.
